# Dynamic Meta Tags

This repository was about me testing if HTML `meta` tags for URL previews in social media could be dynamically generated with JavaScript, to prevent the web developer to actually have to manually copy and paste them into each HTML page separately, and still displaying their proper fields and content.

This test confirmed that dynamically generating those `meta` tags with JavaScript doesn't display a social media preview when putting the URL as a post or in chat in Discord (to give an example).

This makes sense because putting an URL in chat doesn't for sure execute the JavaScript files of the website, but I still wanted to see how and when (at what stage/step) the meta tags are queried/fetched.

I suppose I will leave this repository public, so if you had the same question as me and wanted to test it, you could see the result or share this experiment.
